/*
Moving from point to point, you can get the surface topography by first retracting 
the VCA to almost its bottom (leave maybe 10% range) and move the robot arm vertically 
towards the sample.Â Once you see the encoder value change due to contact, recording the 
end effector XYZ position will give you the desired location to trace the surface 
topography as discrete points.

 * Implementation of a robot application.

 * The application provides a {@link RoboticsAPITask#initialize()} and a

 * the application lifecycle. The application will terminate automatically after 
 * the {@link RoboticsAPITask#run()} method has finished or after stopping the 
 * task. The {@link RoboticsAPITask#dispose()} method will be called, even if an 
 * exception is thrown during initialization or run.
